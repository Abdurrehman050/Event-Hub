# 🧠 How It Works
Hosts can create an account and list their venues with descriptions, prices, and photos.

Customers can browse venues, view detailed information, and make bookings.

An admin panel provides full control over listings and user activities.

SMS verification ensures account authenticity and secure booking communication.
# Steps to run the project:

Download or git clone the whole project.
Open the project in VSCode (ensure you already have the latest Node.js and npm installed on your computer).
cd/move to the backend folder and type "npm install".
After that, go to the backend folder and use this command to run the backend: "node --watch app.js".
The above step will show a message in the command line "server is running on 8000" and "DB connected".

============================== Your server is now ready to accept requests =======================================
